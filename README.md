# Yantra Theme Converter
A tool to convert old-style theme posts for [Yantra Launcher](https://github.com/coderGtm/yantra-app-launcher) to the newer JSON theme files.
## Lore
Formerly, [Yantra Launcher](https://github.com/coderGtm/yantra-app-launcher) sufficed for publicly sharing themes by uploading
them to a Discord server as text posts. A Discord bot named Curator was
developed to standardise the posts and upload the results to
a text channel from where other users could manually apply the theme. Ultimately, a
more rigorous, convenient method was implemented where themes were instead
shared as import/exportable JSON-serialized files.

The older "themes," although just Discord posts, have now been deprecated. They
are difficult to apply unless you manually convert them to JSON, making
a handful of old themes practically unusable. This tool accomplishes this
conversion automatically for your convenience.
